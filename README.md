# ORNLNeutron.github.io
rough draft of http://neutrons.ornl.gov/
Files are found by putting 
<ORNLNeutron.github.io/"FOLDER"/"FILE-NAME">
In the address/url/location bar. 


I have created this as a maquette for the https://neutrons.ornl.gov site. 
This seems the simplest most flexible and dynmaic route of organizing files in the way the scientists choose. 
People want what they want and this allows the flexibility for the individual beams to create the most convenient and efficient structure for their respective beam. 

Make any changes to the website you desire or please let me know and I will make the changes accordingly. 

Thank you.
